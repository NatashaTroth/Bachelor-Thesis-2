similarity and dissimilarity

Clustering is also called data segmentation in some applications because clustering partitions large data sets into groups according to their similarity. Clustering can also be used for outlier detection, where outliers

specify number of clusters before

% The examined SmartEater data set used for this thesis contains multiple attributes to be considered in the clustering process. Therefore, appropriate clustering methods will be used to accommodate high-dimensional data.


% Book defines high-dimensional data as more than 10 attibutes, while (survey of clustering data mining techniques page 33) argues that high-dimensional data starts with more than 16 attributes.


%Richard Bellman [1] coined the phrase the curse of dimensionality to describe the extraordinarily rapid growth in the difficulty of problems as the num- ber of variables (or the dimension) increases. A common experience is that the cost of an algo- rithm grows exponentially with dimension, making the cost prohibitive for moderate or large values of the dimension - richard bellman 1957 dynamic programming - trouble finding
