\section*{Concept}


% Talk about SmartEater.
SmartEater \footnote{\url{https://sites.google.com/site/eatingandanxietylab/resources/smarteater}} is an upcoming mHealth (mobile health) app, with the goal to provide the user with content-dependent feedback, to avert a food craving episode. The app will predict future eating crises based on the user's past behaviour. In order to reduce intense user input, the app records and uses various smartphone sensor data. The following data is recorded by the app:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Background volume
	\item Relative movement of the mobile phone (Gyro and Accel)
	\item Time and duration of phone calls (without storing the numbers)
	\item Time of messages (e.g. SMS, WhatsApp) (without collecting identifying information such as content, addresses, numbers)
	\item Screen activity (so-called touch events)
	\item Screen-On-Time (illuminated display)
	\item Ambient brightness
	\item Data volume per unit of time (summary value of all smartphone activities on the internet)
	\item Switch-on and switch-off times of the smartphone
\end{enumerate}
 With the help of machine learning algorithms and pattern recognition, the recorded situational context data will aid in predicting stress.

The sensor data will be recorded for different lengths of time. It is necessary to determine which time period will be most fitting to make accurate predictions for the future. This thesis will use cluster analysis, a type of data mining, to determine which time period is most significant.

% the book
\textcite{han2011data}[17, 18] declares that data mining is used to discover patterns and knowledge from data. This includes cleaning data, combining multiple sources, selecting and transforming relevant data, and extracting and evaluating data patterns.
Cluster Analysis is a type of machine learning algorithm known as unsupervised machine learning. It is used to divide data into groups (clusters). Each cluster contains data that is similar to each other, but dissimilar to the data allocated to other clusters. Cluster Analysis can be used to acquire knowledge on the distribution of the data, discover characteristics, detect outliers and reduce noise, or to preprocess data for other algorithms \autocite{han2011data}[32, 362, 363, 367].

%According to /textcite, clustering is used to class similar objects together, and dissimilar objects into other classes. 
According to \textcite{bramer2007principles}[311], grouping similar attibutes is applied in various fields such as economics, marketing, medicine, crime analysis and more.

% Write something here about how it is hard to determine which clustering method is the best


%book - page 366-368, 373, 374, 385, 392, 414
There are several different methods to create clustering. \textcite{han2011data}[366-368, 373, 374, 385, 392, 414]  divides them into the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Partitioning methods: The data is divided into \textit{k} (generally pre-defined) number of groups. A data object can only be classified into one group (fuzzy partitioning methods relax this condition). Exmaples: k-means, k-medoids
	\item Hierarchical methods: Data is grouped into a hierarchy of clusters. Either each object creates its own cluster and is then merged to its neighbours until all objects belong to one cluster (agglomerative or bottom-up approach), or all objects for one cluster and are then divided until each object forms its own cluster (divisive or top-down approach). However, once a merge or split has occurred, it cannot be undone. Examples: BIRCH, Chameleon
	\item Density-based methods: While partitioning and hierarchical methods only find clusters with spherical shapes, this method finds clusters with random shapes. It can also remove noise and outliers. Examples: DBSCAN, OPTICS
	\item Grid-based methods: The objects are quantised into grid cells. The operations are performed on the grid structure. This leads to an accelerated processing time. Examples: STING, CLIQUE
\end{itemize}
These methods work well with data sets that are not high-dimensional an have less than 10 attributes. Since the data set used in this thesis only has 9 dimensions, it is not considered high-dimensional and can be utilised in these methods.
%end book

%TODO: explain what methods i will use
%say how have to use different ones to compare

%book page 93
To reduce the size and amount of data, dimensionality reduction will be used. Dimensionality reduction is a type of data reduction, which removes random attributes and creates a smaller data set with close to equal integrity. This thesis will use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality.


%Springer, principles of data mining book - 311 - 313
%According to /textcite, clustering is used to class similar objects together, and dissimilar objects into other classes. 
\textcite{bramer2007principles}[312, 313] explains, that data with a maximum number of 3 attibutes (dimensions) can easily be visualised, as can the resulting clusters. Often there is a higher number of attibutes, which is impossible to visualise.
%end

%Visualizing Data using t-SNE p2579 (abstract!)
\textcite{maaten2008visualizing}[2579] introduce T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) which is used to visualise high-dimensional data and will therefore be employed to depict the data set in this thesis.  

%Explain the experiment and explain which python toolkits will be used
In order to determine how long the smartphone sensor data should be recorded, to receive the best clustering results, the following experiment will be conducted: (--- TODO - prepare the data types). Initially the data for one chosen time length will be be clustered using different clustering methods. These algorithms (--- TODO - say which) will be implemented using the Python library.... (--- TODO - SAY WHICH ONE). Using principal component analysis (PCA), the initial data of the same time length will be reduced and the clustering methods reimplemented. These methods will be reproduced on the other time lengths and compared using ...(--- TODO - how to compare), potentially thus resulting in the time length with the clearest clusters. 

The thesis will be arranged as following:

%predicting weather
% While doing cluster analysis, we first partition the set of data into groups based on data similarity and then assign the labels to the groups.


% This thesis will focus on declaring the most fitting length of time period to log the smartphone data, in order to gain clear clusters.
