\textcite{hartigan1975clustering}[1] describes clustering as a means to group similar objects together. For example, two planets are considered similar, if (given measurement error) it is probable they could be perceived as the same planet. \textcite{romesburg2004cluster}[2] gives the gathering of a variety of pebbles and sorting them into piles of similar attributes (e.g. shape, size, colour) as an example of cluster analysis. \textcite{hartigan1975clustering}[1-3, 6] further explains, that it can be expected from similar objects for them to act and be treated the same. Clustering is also used to name, display, summarise, predict, and require explanation of the objects in the cluster. If some of the objects assigned to a cluster exhibit certain properties, it is expected that the other objects in this cluster will exhibit them as well. Real-world examples of clustering include classifications of animals, plants and diseases.

\textcite{han2011data}[361-363] state, that the objects placed into one cluster are dissimilar to the objects assigned to other clusters. The fact that cluster analysis can find groups by itself, gives it its unique advantage. Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning, since the class label for each group is unknown and needs to be discovered. In data mining, it is utilised to understand the distribution of the data and inspect the distinctions between clusters. Moreover, it can be used to preprocess data for other data mining methods, such as characterisation, attribute subset selection, and classification.
Cluster analysis is used in various fields, including: biology, security, business intelligence, image pattern recognition, and web search. It can be used to place customers into groups, organise projects into categories in project management, and to sort web search results into concise groups. Furthermore, it can be used to detect outliers, since these are located outside of clusters.
